# Test task for amoCRM

This repository contains my test solution for amoCRM.

In solving the first problem, I decided to use various techniques that I have mastered over the past years and I am very proud of the approach with which I did it. Functional approach - ALGA! Reusability - mmmm. Optimization - God save JS.

## Task 1

>Write an implementation of the timer.
>Timer animation step 1 second.
>Format the timer “hh:mm:ss”.
>For example, 01:12:59 is one hour, 12 minutes, 59 seconds.

To solve the second problem, I decided not to show my layout experience, but preferred to use the latest technology to solve the problem. z

## Task 2

> Layout the page according to the layout.
>https://www.figma.com/file/ja6QtJ9gv2JuxSDIAClL1O/Welbex?node-id=0%3A1

To solve the second task, I used the latest technologies and approaches without showing my layout experience. lol :D
In accordance with the task, I made up the page according to the layout, but! The latest technology in the form of AI helped to do this in 3 minutes.
Using a figma plugin called Locofy. It's in BETA, but it did what you can see in the second folder in automatic mode.
Locofy - easy to transfer the layout in any of the available ways. I chose the "HTML + CSS" way, using other ways (like React) I got better code, but this one is fine for demonstration.

The result can be seen in the "2 task" folder.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Familiarize yourself with the contents of the "1 task" and "2 task" folders.
3. To view the result of the timer, open the "index.html" file in the "1 task" folder.
4. To view the layout result, open the "index.html" file in the "2 task" folder.
